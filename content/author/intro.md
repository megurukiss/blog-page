I'm a student at UCSD, who aims to become a software engineer. I'm passionate about learning new technologies and building projects. I'm recently learning backend development with Spring boot. I'm also learning cloud computing and DevOps. I'm excited to share my journey with you.<br>

I love video games. I'm a huge fan of Japanese RPG games. My favorate games are Shin Megami Tensei and Monster hunter series. I also love to watch anime and read manga. I'm learning Japanese and planning to visit Japan in the future.
